Question 1: http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~kdenhartog/

Note: No changes were made to the html when I first gave read access.
      I am now unable to ssh into the linux.cs.uiowa.edu box,
      so it is unable to be changed now.

Chat Client

Arguments required for chat.py
1: the username of the person using this client in the form of a string.
2: the IP and port in the form of IP:port written as a string of this client.
3: A username or the IP and port in the form of IP:port written as a string of who you wish to talk with.
   If a username is used, it will automatically make a lookup call to the registry. If it is unable to
   a value, it will sleep for 5 seconds and retry again.
4: A string that includes the IP address and port number of the directory service.

Notes: to exit the chat after a connection has been made by two clients type exit(1).
       The program will close the socket on the client who typed that command (user 1) and will automatically
       send a message to the user 2 notifying them that the connection was closed and
       close user 2's connection as well.

Arguments required for dirservice.py
1: A string that includes the IP address and port number of the directory service.

Notes: The table must be rebuilt everytime this is restarted. An additional feature to be added later
       would be to take in a csv file as an argument of a stored directory and as new users are added,
       their information will be added to the csv file as well as the dictionary stored in memory.
       Advanced features would utilize an SQL database with prepared statements.
